# Astro vs. Custom-Written Code: Pros and Cons

When considering a switch from a custom-written website to Astro, here's a breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages:

## Pros of Astro:

*   **Performance and Speed:** Astro is designed for speed, generating static HTML by default and sending minimal to zero JavaScript to the client. This "zero JavaScript by default" approach significantly reduces load times and bandwidth usage, leading to faster websites and improved SEO.
*   **Content-Focused:** Astro excels at building content-rich websites like blogs, marketing sites, documentation, portfolios, and e-commerce sites, prioritizing rapid content delivery.
*   **Developer Experience and Ease of Use:** Astro aims to be accessible to all web developers. Its `.astro` UI language is based on HTML, making it familiar, and it simplifies development by reducing the need for complex client-side concepts. It also offers robust developer tools and comprehensive documentation.
*   **Flexibility and Framework Agnostic:** Astro allows developers to use their preferred UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) within the same project. This flexibility enables leveraging existing skills, combining different frameworks on the same page, and preventing vendor lock-in.
*   **Server-First Approach:** Astro prioritizes server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring performance and simplicity without requiring additional server-side languages, as everything is still HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript).
*   **Partial Hydration (Islands Architecture):** Astro's "island architecture" allows for selective hydration, meaning JavaScript components only load when needed for interactivity. This reduces initial load times and bandwidth usage by only delivering necessary JavaScript.

## Cons of Astro:

*   **Niche Use Cases (Historically):** While expanding, Astro's out-of-the-box features were initially very focused on building developer blogs, making its use cases feel a bit niche. However, it's capable of much more through features like Actions.
*   **Newness and Maturity:** As a newer framework, Astro might have a limited plugin ecosystem and lack the same level of maturity as more established frameworks. There's also a potential for breaking changes between major versions.
*   **Not Ideal for Highly Complex SPAs:** For web applications requiring extensive interactivity and large state management, traditional frameworks that leverage Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture might be more suitable, even if it comes at the expense of slower initial load performance.
*   **File-Based Routing (Subjective):** Some developers find file-based routing, which Astro uses, to be an "obnoxious pattern" that can make it difficult to see all routes at a glance and can lead to many tabs with the same filename in an editor.
